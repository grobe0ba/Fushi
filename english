Lesson One - Navigation
Lets start with the basics, type ls. which lists directory contents.
You're probably wondering why no files showed up, because you have none. 
mkdir makes a directory and cd changes directory. 
So lets make some, first mkdir tempdir then cd tempdir
Now touch tempfile, touch updates time stamps and creates a blank file if the file is not there, 
Now run the ls command. As you can see you have created a plain file. 
pwd stands for print working directory, if you ever get lost in your system use it.
pwd will show you exactly where you're at unlike the bash shell which shows only ~ as home.
Use the 'pwd' command now.
There are things called manual pages, the man command will show these pages. type 'man man'. To close a man page hit q
Lesson Two - Files
Keep in mind that silence in unix is good.
cp means copy and we are going to cp a file.
cp the file /var/log/acnt.log to the current dir. Current dir symbol is ./
So next we are going to learn cat and tail. 
Use the cat command to see the full file then use tail to see just the end of the file. 
run cat or tail on acnt.log which is now in the same directory that you are in. 
Moving on to grep. Grep is a great tool
which allows you to search for a a pattern in a file and show it on the screen.
'grep Mike acnt.log' notice the capital M, unix is always case-sensitive. 
Lets move a file. Also renaming a file is moving it with a different name.
The mv command allows you to move around files. 'mv /bin/progfile ./'
Run 'ls -hal'. -h is human readable sizes -a is include .hidden directories -l is list all files in long format
The random letters to the right are important they are x - excutible, r - read, w - write
the reason there are more then one is that there is more then one section
The sections are user, group, everyone. so -rw-r--r-- means you can read and write it and everyone can read it
You might be wondering why . and .. are there, . is the current dir and .. is one dir up.
It's time to learn about chown. chown changes the file's owner. 
chmod changes the file's modes. The 700 mode says you can xrw the file.
run chown $ENV{USER} progfile then run chmod 700 progfile, after that run './progfile' 
rm will remove files.
We no longer need the acnt.log file, remove it now. 'rm acnt.log'
Lesson Three - Environment
Time to learn chsh, short for change shell 
Just type chsh. 
You can change your password by using the 'passwd' command
We will now simulate a passwd change. type 'passwd' to begin.
Lesson Four - Users
Now you can't see it right now but the password you entered earlier was encrypted.
How a user password gets encypted and how it's used is simple.
First a user is added with a password, it encrypts the password and stores it in the encrypted state.
The encrypted password is stored in the master.passwd file, not to be confused with the passwd file.
When the user logs in it takes the password entered, encrypts it then compares it against the stored encrypted password.
Now lets add a user, type adduser to start the process.
Add the username: athos with the password: greece
Good, you have added the user.
Its time to learn about removing users, remove the user 'sventek'
Do this by typing 'rmuser sventek'. Delete everything of his.
Good, you have added the user.
Its time to learn about removing users, remove the user 'sventek'
Do this by typing 'deluser sventek'. Delete everything of his.
Lesson Five - Archives
Say you have multiple files you want to transfer at once, how do you do it?
Well thats simple, tar allows you to create archive files. lets tar progfile and tempfile to one file.
Do this by typing tar -czf temp.tar.gz progfile tempfile. You can also man tar.
So now you have a .tar.gz what do you do with it?
Extract it to get the files out of the archive.
Just type tar -zxvf temp.tar.gz and it will extract the files
Lesson Six - Internet
ifconfig will return internet configuration settings and details.
use the command '/sbin/ifconfig' now or man ifconfig
Use sftp to get a file from a different server, details in a moment. 
Server: afc.com Port: 16012 Username: sfrank Password: darlingducky 
Get the acnt.log file. 
Lesson Seven - Processes
the 'ps' command will show all the processes that you are running.
type 'ps' to simulate this command
the 'kill' command will end the process by force
kill the prockill process by 'kill 4370'
Lesson Eight - Packages
FreeBSD uses ports. First we will learn how to update them, type 'portsnap fetch'
Looking up portsnap.FreeBSD.org mirrors... 3 mirrors found.
Fetching snapshot tag from portsnap1.FreeBSD.org... done.
Fetching snapshot metadata... done.
Fetching 3 metadata patches.. done.
Applying metadata patches... done.
Fetching 0 metadata files... done.
Fetching 2 patches.. done.
Applying patches... done.
Fetching 0 new ports or files... done.
Now we already have most of the ports in /usr/bin/ports so there is no need to extract all of the ports.
On the first time doing this you would use 'portsnap extract' but this is not this systems first time.
Type 'portsnap update' to update just the ports that are out of date
Removing old files and directories... done.
Extracting new files:
/usr/ports/Tools/portbuild/
/usr/ports/astro/google-earth/
/usr/ports/devel/p5-Digest-TransformPath/
/usr/ports/devel/php5-phing/
/usr/ports/graphics/png/
/usr/ports/graphics/rubygem-scruffy/
/usr/ports/graphics/tiff/
/usr/ports/japanese/Canna/
/usr/ports/mail/dovecot/
/usr/ports/mail/xpi-displayquota/
/usr/ports/security/fwbuilder/
/usr/ports/security/libfwbuilder/
/usr/ports/security/vuxml/
/usr/ports/www/gallery/
/usr/ports/www/gallery2/
/usr/ports/www/joomla15/
/usr/ports/x11/kdebase3/
Building new INDEX files...
Now that we updated ports lets update our installed programs 'portupgrade -au'
Again silence is gold. Now let's check our installed programs for exploits. 'portaudit -Fa'
New database installed.
0 problem(s) in your installed packages found.
Now let's update the whole system. This is a two parter, 'freebsd-update fetch'
Looking up update.FreeBSD.org mirrors... 1 mirrors found.
Fetching metadata signature for 6.3-RELEASE from update1.FreeBSD.org... done.
Fetching metadata index... done.
Inspecting system... done.
Preparing to download files... done.
No updates needed to update system
Well we are all up to date, if we weren't we would go on to 'freebsd-update install'
You have completed FUSHI.
Lesson Eight - Packages
Debian uses apt as a package manager, lets update the apt database by typing 'apt-get update'
